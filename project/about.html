            <section class="introAbout">
                <h3>Hi!</h3>
                <p>My name is Annalisa Jaynes and I am currently attending Wake Tech Community College as an Advertising Graphic Design Major. I have some past college in Multi Media Design. I also have many years of experience in Photography, color photo development as well as training in black and white photo dark room development. Being in the dark room is one of my favorite places to be, it feels like an escape to a little dark world of magic.
                    I am very passionate about art, design and creativity. I love to design and create in various ways. I enjoy all forms of creative and performing arts.I look forward to expanding my horizons on the Web.

        <h3>Van Gogh</h3>
        <p> My father exposed me to many aspects of art as I was growing up. Van Gogh was one of the artists he introduced me to.  My father had a book of Van Gogh's art I would always look at and admire. Van Gogh's impressionism art always attracted me, even as a young child. I remember my dad telling me the story of Van Gogh cutting his ear off. It seemed strange as a kid to hear of someone actually doing that. I continued to enjoy Van Gogh's amazing art, none the less.</p>

        <h3>Scott Mutter</h3>
        <p>This photographer is one of my favorites. He created photography pieces called Photomontage, the combining of two or more negatives, in a black and white dark room. He created some amazing pieces. Some of my favorites pieces of his are called "Surrational Images". I love his poster combining an escalator with an ocean with a business man walking on the ocean shore. His unique style of photography has intensly influenced my creativity today.</p>

        <h3>Frank Lloyd Wright</h3>
        <p>I love many types of art and architecture is one of my favorites. My father took us to a book store when I was in elementary school and told us to pick out a book and I picked an architecture book. I remember getting questioned by a boy on the bus as to why I had a book like that. Well that is none of his business, of course I did not say that. Frank Lloyd Wright's unique contemporary Architecture is my favorite. I was able to see Falling Water's in person when I was a teenager. I remember being in awe at his very simple but unique style. I would not mind having one of his designed houses. </p>

                <h3>How My Kids Influence My Art</h3>
                <p>
                    
                    When I am not in my creative La La land I am busy as a Domestic Engineer, aka Mother to 2 amazing kids. My responsibilities include Manager, Chauffer, Psychologist, Comedian, Maid, Fine Dining Chef, Mediator and Referee. All while I strive to provide a positive, educational and loving environment for my kids. My kids are very creative in different ways. When my daughter isn't creating food, accesories, furniture and clothes for barbie or creating a random messy chemistry project in her room. When my son isn't playing with his toy in some far away land of Dinos. We are hiking and playing in nature. My daughter and son both have the ability to put me in a different place of the imagination. I enjoy their creative minds and thought processes.
                     Of course when I am doing an assignment they always want to see the progress. They want to start doing a project of their own.
